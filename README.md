Prediction of the positions of a ping-pong ball by fitting a Bayesian model on the given data, where the model is defined by the Euler-Mayurama discretisation of the equations governing the motion of a ping-pong ball, as described in the research paper "Optimal State Estimation of Spinning Ping-Pong Ball Using Continuous Motion Model".
